## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing
- All tests run on every commit
- Coverage reports generated automatically
- Failed builds block deployments
- Performance regression detection

### Quality Gates
1. All tests must pass
2. Coverage must be ≥70%
3. No critical security vulnerabilities
4. Performance within acceptable limits

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run test:coverage
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
cd tests/e2e
npx playwright test
```

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Tasks
- Review and update test data monthly
- Performance benchmark updates quarterly
- Security test reviews bi-annually
- Coverage threshold reviews annually

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow established patterns and naming conventions
2. Ensure tests are isolated and repeatable
3. Update coverage thresholds if needed
4. Document complex test scenarios

This comprehensive test suite ensures the Project Management System maintains high quality, security, and reliability standards while meeting the ≥70% coverage requirement.
