# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Use OIDC Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for Authentication

**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** System Architecture Team

### Context
The project management system requires secure authentication that works with both web and potentially mobile applications. We need to support single sign-on (SSO) and integrate with enterprise identity providers.

### Decision

### Rationale
1. **Security**: PKCE mitigates authorization code interception attacks, especially important for public clients
2. **Standards Compliance**: OIDC is an industry standard built on OAuth 2.0
3. **Flexibility**: Supports web, mobile, and native applications
4. **Enterprise Ready**: Keycloak provides enterprise features like LDAP integration, MFA, and role management
5. **Future-Proof**: Easily extensible to support additional identity providers

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Enhanced security with industry-standard protocols
- Simplified user management through centralized identity provider
- Support for enterprise SSO integration
- Clear separation between authentication and application logic

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity in setup and configuration
- Dependency on external identity provider
- Requires understanding of OIDC flows

**Risks:**
- Keycloak availability affects application access
- Initial setup complexity may slow development

**Mitigation:**
